  task_type: bugfix
  mistake: Hashtag search typed character-by-character while wait_fastinput_ime timed out, repeatedly erasing input, and space-separated hashtags were treated as a single query.
  correction: Use Mode.PASTE for search bar input, monkeypatch uiautomator2 current_ime regex for Android 14+ FastInputIME, split space-separated sources in hashtag plugins, and handle modern IG v446+ feeds without the Recent tab.
