# About This Project

**InstaAddict** is a fork and continuation of [GramAddict](https://github.com/GramAddict/bot), an open-source Instagram automation bot originally created and maintained by [mastrolube](https://github.com/mastrolube) and the GramAddict community. The original project is no longer actively maintained — Instagram keeps changing its app's UI, and without ongoing fixes those changes silently break automation over time.

We're deeply grateful to the GramAddict team for building such a solid foundation. Their dedication to keeping the bot free, open source, and community-driven made this project possible. InstaAddict picks up where GramAddict left off — actively tracking Instagram's UI changes, fixing compatibility as things break, and keeping the bot alive for the community.

> This project is licensed under the same terms as the original. All credit for the core architecture and original features goes to the GramAddict contributors.

# Why should I automate my Instagram account?

It's hard to grow an account organically these days. Instagram's explore/discovery surfaces mostly favor accounts you already interact with — nobody sees your posts unless you're already getting engagement. InstaAddict helps close that gap by handling the repetitive interaction work (liking, following, watching stories) so real people are more likely to discover and engage with your actual content.

## So do I still need to post good content?

Yes, absolutely. This bot gets you visibility — it doesn't replace having something worth looking at once people arrive.

## I don't know where to start...

That's fine — this README walks you through the whole setup. If you get stuck anywhere, the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/PvxsP8HFa) is there to help.

## I've seen a lot of similar projects on GitHub — why this one?

Most competing bots use direct API requests, which is exactly what gets accounts banned (1–30 days) — Instagram actively watches for that traffic pattern. There are also several closed-source "premium" bots that strip features out of the free tier and charge a subscription to unlock them back, while running encrypted code so you can't verify what it's actually doing on your account.

InstaAddict is free to use and open source, full stop. No paywalled features, no encrypted execution, no subscription. If you want to verify exactly what it does, the code is right here.

## So this bot doesn't use the API?

Correct — it drives the real Instagram app through **adb** and **uiautomator2**, an Android UI-testing framework. Your device (or emulator) is literally used to tap through the app the way a person would, which is far harder for Instagram to distinguish from real usage than API-based bots.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/joeahkim/InstaAddict/raw/master/res/demo.gif">
</p>

## Does that mean I'll never get banned?

No — please configure sensible limits. Real humans don't scroll and interact with hundreds of accounts nonstop all day, and neither should your bot. Aggressive limits (too many follows/likes in a row, spammy PMs) get flagged whether a bot or a person does them. Keep it modest, keep it paced, and it'll stay under the radar.

## Do I need a computer?

Yes for the initial setup, but the bot itself can run [directly on your phone via Termux](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/termux) once configured. You can host it on:

* your computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
* a Raspberry Pi (a cheap, low-power Linux box that can run this unattended)

### Choosing between a physical device or an emulator

Both work. If you're going the emulator route, there's one thing that trips people up: **Instagram's APK is ARM-only**, so your emulator needs either a native ARM system image or built-in ARM translation. Recommended:

* **Windows:** [MEmu](https://www.memuplay.com/) or [LDPlayer](https://www.ldplayer.net/) — both include ARM translation out of the box.
* **macOS:** [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (installable via `brew install --cask android-studio`), but make sure you pick an **ARM64 system image** in the AVD manager, not the default x86_64 one — an x86-only image will fail to install or crash Instagram.

<br />

# Compatibility / known working versions

InstaAddict actively tracks Instagram's UI changes. This is updated as fixes land — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

| Component    | Verified working                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Instagram    | 440.0.0.46.86                    |
| uiautomator2 | 2.16.26                          |
| Python       | **3.13.14**                      |
| Platforms    | Windows, macOS, Termux (Android) |

**Python 3.13.14 is the version currently tested and verified with InstaAddict.** Other Python versions may work, but they are not officially tested at this time.

If something breaks on a newer Instagram version, please [open an issue](https://github.com/joeahkim/InstaAddict/issues) — we treat "this stopped working" reports as our highest-priority bugs, not an afterthought.

<br />

# Quick start

## What you need

* A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
* **Python 3.13.14**
* adb (Android Debug Bridge)
* A physical Android device or an emulator (Android 4.4+)

## Step 1: Install Python

**InstaAddict is currently tested and verified with Python 3.13.14.**

We recommend using **Python 3.13.14** for the most reliable installation and runtime experience.

* **macOS/Linux:** install Python 3.13.14 and verify with `python3 --version`
* **Windows:** [download Python 3.13.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31314/) and make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

Verify your installation:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see:

```text
Python 3.13.14
```

On Windows, you can also use:

```bash
python --version
```

or:

```bash
py --version
```

Check that pip is installed:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

On Windows, `pip --version` may be used instead.

## Step 2: Install InstaAddict

Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended — it isolates this project's dependencies from everything else on your machine.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

* Linux/macOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

* Windows cmd:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

* Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You'll see `(.venv)` at the start of your prompt once it's active.

### With pip (recommended)

```bash
pip3 install instaaddict
```

Verify:

```bash
pip3 show instaaddict
```

### With git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeahkim/InstaAddict.git
cd InstaAddict
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3: Install adb

1. Download [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and unzip it somewhere permanent — not `Downloads`, since that folder tends to get cleared out and will quietly break your setup later.

2. Add the `platform-tools` folder to your `PATH`:

   * **Linux/macOS:** add `export PATH=~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/:$PATH` (adjust the path to wherever you unzipped it) to `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`, then restart your terminal.
   * **Windows:** System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables → edit `Path`, add the full `platform-tools` folder path. **Open a brand-new terminal window afterward** — an already-open terminal won't pick up the change.

3. Verify:

```bash
adb version
```

## Step 4: Set up your device

### Physical device

1. [Enable developer options and USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable).
2. Connect via USB, and tap "Allow" when prompted on the device.

### Emulator

1. Install an ARM-compatible emulator (see emulator notes above) and install Instagram inside it via its Play Store.
2. Enable Developer Options + USB debugging inside the emulated Android the same way as a physical device.
3. Connect adb over TCP (port varies by emulator — check its settings panel):

```bash
adb connect localhost:21503
```

**Verify the connection either way:**

```bash
adb devices
```

You should see a device listed:

```text
List of devices attached
A0B1CD2345678901    device
```

That identifier is your device ID — only needed if multiple devices are connected at once.

## Step 5: Start the bot

InstaAddict requires Instagram to be set to [English](https://help.instagram.com/111923612310997).

1. Initialize uiautomator2 on your device:

```bash
python3 -m uiautomator2 init
```

If you have multiple devices/emulators connected, target a specific one:

```bash
python3 -m uiautomator2 init <device-id>
```

2. Run the bot, pointing at a new account config:

```bash
python3 run.py --config accounts/your_ig_username/config.yml
```

If the `accounts/your_ig_username/` folder doesn't exist yet, it's created automatically from the template in `config-examples/` on first run — review the generated `config.yml` (especially the `device:` field) before running again.

3. Configuration reference: [docs.gramaddict.org](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/configuration)

# Common setup issues

These come up on fresh installs regardless of OS — worth checking here before opening an issue.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'`**

`setuptools` removed `pkg_resources` starting at v82.0.0. Install the standalone replacement:

```bash
pip3 install standard-pkg-resources
```

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'`**

`distutils` was removed from Python's standard library in 3.12+. This usually means your `packaging` library is outdated. Upgrade it:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade packaging
```

**Both errors on the same fresh install?**

Run this once to resolve the whole chain in one shot:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools packaging standard-pkg-resources adbutils uiautomator2
```

**`ModuleNotFoundError` for `configargparse`, `imageio`, or `websocket-client`**

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**`pip install --break-system-packages`**

On some Linux distros and Termux, pip refuses to install into the system Python ("externally managed environment"). Add `--break-system-packages` to the install command, or better, make sure you're inside an activated virtual environment first.

**`adb` not recognized after adding it to PATH (Windows)**

Close and reopen your terminal — PATH changes don't apply to already-open sessions. Also double check you're actually in PowerShell (`PS` in the prompt) vs. Command Prompt, since the two don't share environment state.

# Bot crashed — what do I do?

This isn't a perfect science — Instagram's UI shifts under us regularly, so things do break sometimes. Open a ticket in [#crash-reports on Discord](https://discord.gg/PvxsP8HFa) rather than posting your Instagram username publicly on GitHub. Attach the crash zip from your `crashes/` folder — that's usually enough for us to pin down what changed.

# Talk botty with us
