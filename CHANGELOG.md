## v1.3.0 — Modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) & Live Dashboard

Feature release introducing a modern, high-performance terminal user interface and live dashboard powered by `rich`, featuring real-time visual progress bars against safety limits, active target and cooldown context, and a live rolling log stream with automated headless fallback and legacy console encoding resilience.

### Added
- **Photo Form Factor & Aspect Ratio Preservation Engine (`InstaAddict/plugins/upload_posts.py`, `core/resources.py`, `test/test_upload_aspect_ratio.py`)**:
  - Implemented automatic image aspect ratio detection via Pillow (`PIL.Image`), accurately distinguishing `landscape` (width/height > 1.05), `portrait` (width/height < 0.95), and `square` form factors.
  - Built multi-tier composer aspect ratio adjustment in `UploadPostsPlugin`:
    - **Tier 1 (Modern Instagram v446+)**: Opens the `Ratio` creation tool from the horizontal toolstrip, selects the matching `Landscape` or `Portrait` option from the bottom sheet modal, and applies with `bottom_sheet_done_button`.
    - **Tier 2 (Classic Cropper Fallback)**: Toggles aspect ratio via `cropper_toggle_button` or `descriptionMatches="(?i).*(crop|aspect ratio|full size|expand).*"`.
  - Automatically dismisses initial blocking composer modals before ratio adjustment to guarantee frictionless navigation.
  - Added `--upload-force-square` CLI argument and `upload-force-square: true/false` YAML configuration option for operators who explicitly want 1:1 square crop.
  - Created 13-case unit test suite (`test/test_upload_aspect_ratio.py`) with 100% pass rate and zero regressions across existing upload test suites.
- **Autonomous Out-of-Band Watchdog Daemon & Blinking LED Heartbeat (`InstaAddict/core/watchdog.py`, `core/tui.py`, `core/bot_flow.py`, `core/utils.py`, `core/session_state.py`, `core/views.py`, `core/filter.py`)**:
  - Implemented `BotWatchdog` background daemon thread running completely isolated from the main bot loop and ADB socket hangs.
  - Implemented 3-Tier Escalation Recovery Strategy:
    - Tier 1 (Soft Recovery - 90s Inactivity): Non-blocking isolated subprocess dispatch of `KEYCODE_WAKEUP` (`224`) and `KEYCODE_BACK` (`4`) to dismiss blocking overlays and restore screen navigation.
    - Tier 2 (Task Skip - 105s Inactivity): Automatically triggers task skip via `DashboardManager.trigger_skip_task()` and `.skip_task` IPC to advance to the next scheduled task without process termination.
    - Tier 3 (Nuclear Restart - 120s Inactivity): Force-stops `com.instagram.android` and relaunches app via Android monkey launcher `1`.
  - Added a blinking "LED light" heartbeat indicator in the top-right corner of the TUI terminal interface panel:
    - `🟢 [● LIVE]` pulsing green dot when execution is healthy and fresh.
    - `🔵 [⏸️ PAUSED]` steady blue indicator during intentional sleeps, cooldowns, or off-hours (`wait_for_next_session`).
    - `🟡 [● STALLED {elapsed}s]` bright yellow warning when activity has stalled (>30s).
    - `🔴 [▲ RECOVERING #{attempts}]` flashing bright red alert during active recovery escalation.
  - Resolved reentrant lock deadlock in `DashboardManager` by migrating `self._lock` from `threading.Lock()` to `threading.RLock()`.
  - Decoupled operational metrics (`ads_bypassed`, `dialogs_dismissed`, `profiles_checked`, `profiles_skipped`) from TUI state via `SessionState.get_active()`, guaranteeing 100% accurate metric tracking in headless and CLI modes.
  - Added `totalWatchdogRecoveries` metric to `SessionState`, `SessionStateEncoder`, and the TUI operational metrics table.
  - Created 11-case test suite (`test/test_watchdog.py`) with 100% pass rate (201/201 tests passing project-wide).
- **Task Skip Shortcut & Fast Next-Task Navigation Engine (`InstaAddict/core/tui.py`, `core/utils.py`, `core/bot_flow.py`, `core/handle_sources.py`, `plugins/interact_reels.py`, `plugins/action_unfollow_followers.py`)**:
  - Implemented interactive keyboard shortcuts `[S]` (Skip) and `[N]` (Next) in `KeyboardListenerThread` to immediately abort the currently active job/source and advance to the next scheduled task in the queue.
  - Implemented file-based IPC signal watcher (`accounts/<username>/.skip_task`) enabling external scripts, Telegram commands, or background sessions to skip tasks without direct console keystrokes.
  - Added instant countdown termination in `InstaAddict/core/utils.py:countdown()` when a skip is requested.
  - Hooked task skip consumption at `bot_flow.py` dispatch level and graceful loop breakouts across `handle_posts()`, `handle_likers()`, `handle_blogger()`, `interact_reels()`, `action_unfollow_followers()`, and `interact_with_user()`.
  - Updated TUI footer, stats shortcuts summary, and active execution context panel with live skip status feedback.
- **Reels Engagement Deadlock Elimination & Telemetry Synchronization (`InstaAddict/core/views.py`, `plugins/interact_reels.py`, `core/handle_sources.py`, `core/session_state.py`)**:
  - Replaced `return True, 0` with `return False, -1` in `PostsViewList._find_likers_container` for full-screen Reels viewer mode, resolving the root cause of 100% skipped posts in hashtag and feed sources when `min_likers > 0`.
  - Added `sessions[-1].totalWatched` increment per watched reel in `interact_reels.py`, syncing the Watched metric in the TUI.
  - Added `UniversalActions.detect_block(device)`, `sessions[-1].totalLikes += 1`, and `sessions[-1].add_interaction("interact-reels", ...)` on double-tap likes in `interact_reels.py`.
  - Passed dynamic `current_user` instead of hardcoded `"REEL_STALKER"` to `_comment` in `interact_reels.py`, enabling comment confirmation and `totalComments` incrementing.
  - Added `session_state.add_interaction("feed", ...)` on feed likes in `handle_sources.py`.
  - Resolved historical defect in `SessionState.add_interaction` where non-scraping interactions (`scraped=False`) reset `successfulInteractions[source]` to `0`.
- **Instagram Grid Peek Preview Direct Liking Engine & Fast Tap (`InstaAddict/core/views.py`, `interaction.py`)**:
  - Implemented native detection for Instagram's 3D Touch / long-press Peek Preview modal (`is_peek_preview_opened()` and `is_peek_already_liked()`).
  - Implemented direct in-preview liking (`like_in_peek()`) so navigation effort is never wasted when the preview modal triggers, immediately registering likes in session state and telemetry.
  - Implemented immediate modal dismissal (`dismiss_peek()`), eliminating 25–40s timeout cascades on standard feed element locators.
  - Hardened `PostsGridView.navigateToPost` with element center coordinate tapping `(x_center, y_center)` to evade Android's ~400ms `OnLongClickListener` threshold.
- **Consecutive Failure Circuit Breaker & Verified Profile Exit (`InstaAddict/core/interaction.py`, `handle_sources.py`)**:
  - Added `consecutive_open_failures` circuit breaker in `interact_with_user`: dismisses lingering overlays on failure and automatically aborts stuck profiles after 2 consecutive post open failures.
  - Replaced blind single `device.back()` in `handle_sources.py` (`handle_posts` and `handle_likers`) with a verified `ProfileView._is_still_on_profile()` loop (up to 4 iterations), guaranteeing a clean return to source feeds before subsequent swiping.
- **Live Operational Effort & Real-Time Throughput Counters (`InstaAddict/core/tui.py`, `session_state.py`)**:
  - Extended `SessionState` and `DashboardState` with real-time operational effort tracking: Posts Scanned, Profiles Checked, Profiles Skipped (with dynamic Filter Pass Rate %), Reels Evaluated, Ads Bypassed, and Dialogs Dismissed.
  - Eliminated the static stats illusion where conversion KPI limits remained frozen at 0% during long filtering intervals.
  - Wired dynamic action telemetry directly into `handle_sources.py`, `filter.py`, `interact_reels.py`, and `views.py`.
- **Content Queue Discovery & Telemetry Engine (`InstaAddict/core/tui.py`)**:
  - Live scanning of `accounts/<username>/content_queue/` reporting pending photos count, total published items, elapsed time since last upload, and rate-limit cooldown status.
  - Properly handles supported media (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.mp4`) while ignoring sidecar `.txt` and `.json` metadata.
- **Interactive Keyboard Listener & On-Demand Upload Shortcut (`[U]`)**:
  - Cross-platform non-blocking daemon thread (`KeyboardListenerThread`) with Windows `msvcrt` and POSIX `select` implementations, guarded by `isatty()` for non-TTY environments.
  - Pressing `[U]` queues an immediate photo upload from the pending queue, consumed by `bot_flow.py` via `UploadPostsPlugin(upload_force=True)`.
  - Pressing `[D]` forces an immediate screen refresh.
- **Responsive 3-Subtable TUI Dashboard Layout**:
  - Re-architected statistics display into 3 clean side-by-side sub-tables (KPI Limits, Real-Time Effort, Content Queue & Publishing) on standard terminals (height >= 28), with an automated space-saving summary fallback on smaller console windows.
- **Unit Test Coverage (`test/test_tui_dashboard.py`)**:
  - Expanded test suite to 25 automated unit tests covering effort counters, queue filesystem discovery, keyboard listener dispatch, non-TTY graceful termination, and responsive layout scaling (173/173 total repo tests passing).
- **Terminal User Interface Engine (`InstaAddict/core/tui.py`)**:
  - Thread-safe `DashboardState` with reentrant locks (`RLock`) synchronizing metrics (likes, follows, unfollows, comments, watches, uploads, crashes, total interactions) and configured limits against bot execution threads.
  - Multi-tier `rich` layout with live 4 Hz refresh rate: Header banner with account and device telemetry, progress bars with color-coded safety thresholds, active job and target context, and rolling log panel with severity color coding.
  - Responsive terminal layout adaptation: dynamically transitions between dual-column view (width >= 85) and single-column stacked view (width < 85).
- **Log Stream Redirection Bridge (`InstaAddict/core/log.py`)**:
  - `TuiLogHandler` capturing logging records, stripping ANSI escape sequences, splitting multiline records, enforcing 120-character line bounds, and piping entries into a bounded ring buffer (`maxlen=30`).
  - Seamless stdout handler decoupling during live execution and clean restoration before summary report printing.
- **CLI Flags & Auto-Detection (`InstaAddict/plugins/core_arguments.py`)**:
  - Added `--tui` and `--no-tui` flags with automatic `isatty()` interactive console detection and headless/CI fallback.
- **Cross-Platform Console & Encoding Hardening**:
  - Implemented `safe_glyph(glyph, fallback)` detecting `sys.stdout.encoding` capabilities and falling back to clean ASCII equivalents on non-UTF-8 Windows consoles (`cp1252`/`cp437`) to eliminate `UnicodeEncodeError`.
  - Configured `Console(safe_box=True)` to prevent box-drawing character corruption on legacy command prompts.
  - Registered `atexit.register(self.stop)` in `DashboardManager` and `try...finally:` in `countdown()` to guarantee terminal restoration and cursor visibility upon exit or interrupt.
- **Upstream Feature & Build Compatibility Alignment (Audit #062)**:
  - Validated full integration of all upstream bugfixes from `joeahkim/InstaAddict` PRs #10, #11, #14, #17, #24, #25, and #26.
  - Bumped tested Instagram version target to `447.0.0.55.81` (`InstaAddict/__init__.py`).
  - Synchronized `pyproject.toml` dependencies with `requirements.txt` (`uiautomator2~=2.16.19`, `packaging~=26.2`, `standard-pkg-resources>=1.0.0`, `imageio[ffmpeg]`, `websocket-client`, `rich>=13.0.0`).

### Fixed
- **Telegram Inbox Fatal TypeError & Silent TUI Crash Remediation (`InstaAddict/plugins/telegram.py`, `core/bot_flow.py`, `core/log.py`)**:
  - Removed invalid `"operation": True` from `--telegram-inbox` in `TelegramReports` argument definition, preventing `telegram-inbox` from being erroneously scheduled as an operational interaction job.
  - Added defensive argument handling in `TelegramReports.run()` with `*args, **kwargs` and action dispatcher detection, preventing `TypeError` if invoked via the operational plugin dispatcher.
  - Added explicit removal of `telegram-inbox` from `jobs_list` in `bot_flow.py`.
  - Updated `handle_uncaught_exception` in `InstaAddict/core/log.py` to automatically tear down active `DashboardManager` and reattach console logging before delegating to `sys.__excepthook__`, ensuring crash tracebacks are clearly visible in the console.
  - Added regression test suite in `test/test_telegram_inbox.py` verifying argument metadata, dispatch resilience, and excepthook TUI teardown.

## v1.2.1 — Modal Dialog Dismissal, Rate Instagram Handling & Stuck-Screen Self-Healing

Resilience patch release introducing universal non-destructive modal popup dismissal (specifically targeting "Rate Instagram", push notification requests, contact sync, and system ANR dialogs), post-upload popup sweeping, and 4-tier escalated stuck-screen recovery with clean app relaunch.

### Added
- **Universal Modal Dialog Dismissal Engine (`UniversalActions.dismiss_dialog`)**:
  - Safe priority handling for "Rate Instagram" dialogs: strictly clicks "No, thanks" or "Remind me later" and excludes "Rate Instagram" to prevent exiting to the Google Play Store.
  - Multi-tier matching for negative/dismissive options: `"Not now"`, `"Cancel"`, `"Skip"`, `"Maybe later"`, `"Don't allow"`, `"Never"`, `"No"`, `"Close"`.
  - Fallbacks for informational acknowledgments (`"OK"`, `"Got it"`, `"Continue"`), resource IDs (`NEGATIVE_BUTTON`), and system ANRs (`"Wait"`).
- **Post-Upload Dialog Sweeping (`UploadPostsPlugin._upload_to_ig`)**:
  - 3-iteration dialog sweep immediately following confirmed post publication to neutralize popups before subsequent jobs execute.
- **Escalated Stuck-Screen Self-Healing (`UniversalActions.recover_stuck_screen`)**:
  - 4-tier recovery protocol: dialog dismissal -> Android back key sequences -> Home tab navigation -> clean application restart (`app_stop` + `app_start`) when persistent navigation deadlocks occur.
- **Resilient Tab Bar Navigation & Inter-Job Recovery (`TabBarView._navigateTo`, `bot_flow.py`)**:
  - Automatically sweeps obscuring dialogs if tab buttons are not found on first pass.
  - Replaced flawed `is_tab_bar_visible()` breakout with profile username validation and clean-restart escalation, ensuring subsequent scheduled jobs are not abandoned.
- **Unit Test Coverage (`test/test_dialog_dismissal_and_stuck_recovery.py`)**:
  - 10 automated unit tests covering all dismissal tiers, rate dialog priority, back navigation fallback, and app restart triggers.

- **Security & Subprocess Hardening (OWASP A03:2021)**:
  - Converted 100% of internal ADB and OS execution calls in `InstaAddict/core/utils.py` and `InstaAddict/core/device_facade.py` from `shell=True` to parameterized argument lists with defensive timeouts.
  - Eliminated potential command injection vectors on external URLs and system settings.
- **Privacy Decoupling & Account Isolation**:
  - Decoupled hardcoded persona strings and localized hashtag fallbacks in `gemini_vision.py`, `hashtag_manager.py`, and `upload_posts.py` into generic creator defaults.
  - Enhanced `scripts/check_telegram.py` to auto-discover active account configurations without hardcoded usernames.

### Fixed
- Fixed inter-job navigation stall where background view hierarchy reporting `is_tab_bar_visible() == True` bypassed back presses and caused profile lookups to fail under active modal overlays.
- Verified zero credentials, personal handles, or private environment files are tracked in public git history.

## v1.2.0 — Telegram Two-Way Ingestion, AI Retry Architecture & Upload Scheduling Resilience

Comprehensive release introducing two-way Telegram remote photo and caption ingestion, 5-attempt exponential backoff retry engine for Gemini Vision AI, mandatory caption elaboration and hashtag enrichment pre-upload, and upload queue prioritization at session startup.

### Added
- **Two-Way Telegram Bot Ingestion (`telegram.py`, `check_telegram.py`)**:
  - Remote photo and video ingestion directly from Telegram chat into `accounts/<username>/content_queue/pending/`.
  - Companion comment ingestion linking follow-up text messages to recently queued media sidecars (`.txt`).
  - Interactive bot commands (`/status`, `/pending`, `/elaborate`, `/caption`) and photo preview confirmations.
  - Standalone long-polling listener and diagnostic tool `scripts/check_telegram.py` with Windows UTF-8 console support.
- **5-Attempt Exponential Backoff Retry Architecture**:
  - Multi-attempt retry loop with progressive backoff delays ($2s, 4s, 6s, 8s$) across Gemini Vision API and HashtagManager calls.
  - Resilient mitigation of Google Cloud HTTP 500, 503, 504 Deadline Exceeded, and empty response states.
- **Mandatory Pre-Upload Caption Elaboration & Hashtag Enrichment**:
  - Automatically evaluates incoming media with Gemini Vision AI (`gemini-3.6-flash`) using the account persona and user guidance.
  - Automatically queries `HashtagManager` to append at least 3–5 rotating niche hashtags if fewer than 3 exist in the caption.
  - Persists finalized, formatted captions back to `.txt` sidecars on disk.
- **Upload Job Prioritization**:
  - Dynamically places `upload-posts` at index 0 of the session `jobs_list` before randomized interaction tasks to prevent upload starvation from subsequent soft crash limits.

### Fixed & Hardened
- **Google Generative AI Model Migration**:
  - Migrated from deprecated/high-load models to Google's recommended `gemini-3.6-flash`.
- **IME Unicode Cluster Sanitization**:
  - Stripped rogue Zero-Width Joiner (ZWJ `\u200D`), Zero-Width Space (ZWSP `\u200B`), and BOM characters from generated text to protect Android FastInputIME.
  - Atomic grapheme cluster typing in `DeviceFacade` preventing multi-part emoji keystroke corruption.
- **ACP-01 Casing Alignment**:
  - Corrected header casing in `agent/commands/acp.proceed.md` to satisfy deterministic scanner requirements.

**Full diff**: `v1.1.0...v1.2.0`

## v1.1.0 — Modern Reels Architecture, Dynamic Hashtag Engine & Fluid Swiping

Comprehensive release introducing modern Instagram (v446+) Reels viewer compatibility, tiered dynamic hashtag discovery, persistent non-bot followings caching, universal in-app browser escape watchdog, and fluid native swipe physics.

### Added
- **Modern Reels & Clips Viewer Compatibility**:
  - Full support for Instagram's full-screen video viewer (`clips_viewer_view_pager`, `root_clips_layout`, `clips_viewer_container`).
  - Added multi-tier author resolution for `clips_author_username`, `clips_author_profile_pic` (regex content description extraction), and `clips_author_info_component`.
  - Added native Reels like button support (`ResourceID.LIKE_BUTTON`).
  - Added fast Reel caption extraction (`CLIPS_CAPTION_COMPONENT`) with immediate termination to prevent futile scroll loops.
- **Tiered Masterlist & Dynamic Hashtag Discovery Engine (`HashtagManager`)**:
  - Curated 4-tier pool in `accounts/<username>/hashtags.yml` across Local Community, Breed/Niche, Lifestyle/Adventure, and Reach tiers.
  - Strategy 1: AI Gemini Persona Expansion (`--expand-hashtags`) synthesizing high-conversion niche tags grounded in account persona.
  - Strategy 2: Zero-overhead in-app caption harvesting (`harvest_from_caption`) tracking cross-session tag frequency in `discovered_hashtags.json`.
  - Enforced deterministic rules: R-ADD-1..4 (promotion thresholds, anti-spam blacklist, semantic relevance, tier assignment), R-ROT-1..3 (2:2:1:1 tier-balanced sampling, 2-session anti-fatigue cooldowns, shuffle), and R-PRN-1..2 (0-result dead tag pruning, 7-day saturation benching).
  - Added CLI options: `--expand-hashtags`, `--no-harvest-hashtags`, and `--hashtags-file`.
- **Persistent Non-Bot Followings Cache**:
  - High-performance atomic JSON storage in `accounts/<username>/non_bot_followings.json`.
  - Instant O(1) in-memory lookups and batch disk writes at scroll boundaries.
  - Pre-seeded checked set in `ActionUnfollowFollowers` for fast-skipping known non-bot accounts without UI polling or log spam.
  - Automatic cache invalidation on follow and unfollow state transitions.
  - Added CLI options: `--clear-non-bot-cache` and `--ignore-non-bot-cache`.
- **Universal Ad Detection & In-App Browser Escape Watchdog**:
  - Automated detection and dismissal of `BrowserLiteInMainProcessIGActivity` and external browser overlays via native close buttons, fallback back-presses, and foreground recovery.
  - Whitelisted Android system packages (`com.android.systemui`, `android`, IME keyboards) against false dismissal.
  - Bounded CTA button coordinate detection to prevent false ad classifications.
- **Task Sequence Randomizer**:
  - Implemented `--randomize-tasks` / `randomize_task_sequence` to shuffle job execution order on every session for human-like behavior.

### Changed & Improved
- **Decoupled Author Resolution from Ad Detection**:
  - Removed faulty `(False, True, is_hashtag)` return in `views.py` when author view is unclickable; returns `(False, False, is_hashtag)`. Organic posts with non-clickable headers are no longer falsely marked as advertisements and skipped.
- **Fluid Single-Swipe Navigation & 200ms Swipe Physics**:
  - Replaced jerky multi-swipe sequences with a single vertical swipe (80% down to 20% height) for Reels.
  - Removed redundant `HALF_PHOTO` swipe call in `handle_sources.py`.
  - Stripped obsolete 3-retry gap-view loop searching for deprecated `GAP_VIEW_AND_FOOTER_SPACE`.
  - Calibrated native ADB swipe duration to 200ms (`adb shell input swipe x1 y1 x2 y2 200`), achieving snappy and natural mobile flick gestures.

**Full diff**: `v1.0.3...v1.1.0`

## v1.0.3 — Production Telemetry, Error Hardening & Self-Learning System

Production-grade error handling, automated telemetry, continuous non-overwritten reporting, and closed-loop self-learning parameter optimization.

### Added
- **Error Trace Logging (`_error_trace.log`)**: Dedicated warning and error logger capturing third-party errors (`uiautomator2`, `adbutils`, network stack) alongside InstaAddict events.
- **Top-Level Crash Interception**: Installed global `sys.excepthook` to guarantee fatal unhandled Python exceptions are written to the error trace log before process exit.
- **Full State Telemetry**: Expanded `SessionState` and `SessionStateEncoder` to track and persist `totalCrashes`, `totalUploadsSuccess`, `totalUploadsFailed`, and `uploadHistory` into `accounts/{username}/sessions.json`.
- **Upload Outcome Recording**: Enhanced `UploadPostsPlugin` to log upload executions, file names, captions, and statuses directly into the active session state.
- **Continuous Markdown History**: Automated `save_markdown_history()` on session completion (`print_full_report()`), appending to `accounts/{username}/history.md` (never overwritten) and generating timestamped session summaries in `accounts/{username}/reports/session_{timestamp}.md`.
- **Dogfood Self-Learning Optimizer (`DogfoodOptimizer`)**: Implemented `InstaAddict/core/dogfood.py` to analyze run history, error patterns, and source yields, generating automated configuration tuning recommendations in `tuning_suggestions.json` and `tuning_suggestions.md`.
- **Enhanced Data Analytics Markdown Export**: Upgraded `InstaAddict/plugins/data_analytics.py` to render complete tables of interaction yields, crashes, and content queue uploads.

### Fixed
- **Windows File Lock Descriptor Leak**: Explicitly closed file handlers before calling `os.remove()` in `update_log_file_name()`, eliminating Windows `PermissionError: [WinError 32]`.
- **Swipe Jitter & Drag Stalls**: Replaced uiautomator2 dragging with native `adb shell input swipe` for smooth and natural scroll gestures.
- **Gemini API 429 Quota & Safety Hardening**: Added exponential backoff retry loops, 512x512 LANCZOS payload compression, and safety-block fallback sanitizers.

**Full diff**: `v1.0.2...v1.0.3`

## v1.0.2 — Instagram compatibility & reliability fixes

Two weeks of accumulated fixes for running InstaAddict against current Instagram versions (tested against 440.0.0.46.86), plus dependency and packaging cleanup.

### Instagram UI compatibility
- Handle IG 438+'s account switcher via `content-desc` fallback matching, since the previous selector no longer matches the current layout
- Handle Instagram's follower-list restriction gracefully instead of crashing when a target's list is rate-limited
- Detect and skip sponsored/ad posts in the feed instead of mishandling them
- Fixed post likers list opening the wrong profile: `open_likers_container()` was misclicking the first liker's avatar/username instead of opening the full likers list — fixed in both the primary selector path and the XML-hierarchy compatibility fallback
- Fixed stricter photo/video detection: a `video_container` element alone is no longer enough to classify a post as a video, since photo posts on current IG also carry overlay badges matching that element. A post is now only classified as video if a play button or timer is present too — closes #5
- Fixed back-navigation overshoot after opening a post: replaced a fixed-count back-press assumption with a state check (stop once the profile tab bar is visible again, capped at 3 presses), preventing the bot from overshooting back to the blogger's likers list between posts
- Fixed `_check_if_last_post()` hanging indefinitely (sometimes for hours) on collab/repost posts where the caption is attributed to a different account than the profile owner — added a retry cap and a graceful fallback
- Fixed posts with undetectable media type (`MediaType.UNKNOWN`) being silently skipped by the like logic instead of falling back to the standard like flow
- Reworked unfollow-from-list to use the current three-dots options menu instead of a now-removed direct "Following" button; accounts with no Unfollow option available are now collected and reported via Telegram at the end of a run instead of being logged as crashes

### Stability
- Fixed `DeviceFacade.is_alive()` throwing `AttributeError` on current `uiautomator2` (`_is_alive()` and `.server.alive` were both removed upstream) — replaced with a functional check against `.info`
- Fixed a narrow `except uiautomator2.JSONRPCError` clause throwing its own `AttributeError` and masking the real underlying error, since `JSONRPCError` is no longer a valid top-level attribute on current `uiautomator2`

### Setup & packaging
- Package directory fully renamed from `GramAddict` to `InstaAddict`
- Account folders now auto-created from `config-examples/` on first run instead of requiring manual setup
- `requirements.txt`: added `imageio` and `websocket-client` (previously undeclared runtime dependencies), and resolved `setuptools`/`pkg_resources` breakage on Python 3.13

**Full diff**: `v1.0.1...v1.0.2`

## 1.0.1 (2026-07-18) - First InstaAddict Release

- set the screen timeout to 5 minutes if it's less than this value to avoid screen off issues
- store the target source in json instead of a duplicate of the username
- store request and followed status in json (it uses to be only followed)
- using `app_current` instead `info` for checking if the app is opened
- check for crash dialog when app crashes
- check if it's a live video before opening a story
- for actions with files (`interact-from-file`, `unfollow-form-file` and `remove-followers-from-file`) the script will look inside your account folder and no longer where you start the bot from
### Others
- bump version of UIA2
- trim logs in crash reports
- put your username inside the config when creating it with `gramaddict init username`
- default value for `can-reinteract-after` is now "None" instead of "-1"
- better logs when skipping profiles

- simplify some functions
### Others

- a lot of typos
- some types hint

## 3.0.0 (2022-01-05)
### New Features

- use the cloned app instead the official, if the dialog box get displayed (this is currently supporter for MIUI devices)
- new filter options: *interact_if_public* and *interact_if_private*
- *interact_only_private* has been removed, delete it from your filters.yml

### Performance improvements

- limit check was wrong in interact_blogger plugin
- feed job was ignoring limits
- don't throw an error if config files \*.yaml instead of \*.yml are used
- likes_limit was referring to total_likes_limit and not current_likes_limit (that caused an error if you specify an interval)

### Performance improvements

- jobs have been split in "active-" and "unfollow-" jobs. That means, for example, that the bot won't stop the activity if it reached the likes limit, and you scheduled to unfollow.

- bot flow improved
- feed job improvements
- looking for description improvements
- better handle of empty biographies
- showing session ending conditions at bot start
- countdown before starting, so you can check that everything is ok (filters and ending conditions)
- before starting, the bot will tell you the filters you are going to use (there is no spell check there, if you wrote them wrong they will be displayed there but not get considered)
- disable head notifications while the bot is running
- removed unnecessary argument in check_limit function
- removed some unnecessary classes in story view
- move Filter instance outside of plugins
